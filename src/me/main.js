I know how to make dashboards, panels, login / registration systems and more. I always deep learn, developers are active learners, they want to stay tuned about the best techs to exploit, and making brilliant projects. I'm young and I never did numeric science courses, so I'm something like a self-taught developer. I very like my job and I love helping my fellows" />
            <Block name="Why I do this ?" description="Because I like to share, I like to create, I like to teamwork, and self expression. There are no limits when you know how to code things, we fix our own limits. I found all of these things in coding, see something, do something. Having an idea, just a word, and making a whole project around it with some teamwork around it. Getting advices from other developers and hiring is life changing for me. And finally because I have a certain sense of the UI/UX design that follow me in whatever I do, I like things that are well made, good looking and working !" />
